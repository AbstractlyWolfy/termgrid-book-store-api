# TermGrid Book Store
Building a book store api and frontend for TermGrid as a demonstration of my ability.

## Setup

- Go to "/resources"
- Rename "application.properties.example" to "application.properties"
- Configure "application.properties" with relevant configuration

# Future considerations

A future consideration for this project is to move all images over to a file storage/CDN solution, at present we store profile pictures and book images in the database, which not only takes up more space, but also could lead to future issues with speed.
